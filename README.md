Java Microsoft CryptoAPI (JMSCAPI)
========================

JMSCAPI provides Java programms access to MSCAPI functions without writing anything but Java codeâ€”no JNI or native code is required. It based on JNA.

For now it is just some JNA mappings of MSCAPI functions and util funtions for MSCAPI routine. In future it will be a genuine JCE provider [or it will be a separete project
and this code will be pulled in JNA, I havn`t desided yet :) ]

*NOTE: It`s very raw and you probably you will not want to use it for now.
